Emma: OMG I did the same once! Thought it was the kitchen.
You: So embarrassing lol
Emma: If you ever need a guide, I’m here. Been around a while.
You: Thanks! Actually, is there a good place nearby for coffee?

Emma: Sure! Let me know when you’re free ☕💬

📱 Conversation 2: Asking for Help with a Project
You: Hey Mark! Got a sec?
Mark: Yo! Yeah, what’s up?
You: I’m debugging something in the auth module and I can’t figure out why the login redirect fails. Mind taking a look?
Mark: Send it over. I’m curious now.
You: Just dropped you a Gist.
Mark: 👀 ...Ahh okay, I see it. Looks like handleRedirect() is returning undefined. You probably want to await the promise here.
You: Omg you’re right. Totally missed that.
Mark: Easy fix. We’ve all been there.
You: You saved me. Coffee’s on me next time. ☕
Mark: Haha deal. Debugging buddies for life. 😄
You: Appreciate you, man.
